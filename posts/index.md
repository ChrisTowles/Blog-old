## Overview

I am software architect and full stack developer offering over 15 years experience and constantly seeking to work with newer technologies. My focus is on web development, particularly web applications using JavaScript frameworks such as `vue`, angular and react.

I have also been responsible for the build out of infrastructure for scale, backup, and redundancy, as well as setting up Continuous Integration processes.
