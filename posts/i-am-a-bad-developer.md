So a few things have happened lately that have have made reflect on what type of developer I am.

And the collusion: "I am a bad developer".

## Let me try to explain

I've been thinking about my software career, not the Craftsmanship. Not just do i write tests or refactor but am i a good developer? For the community, for my self and for my career.

Here are a few of the events and things have been on my mind.

### Tweet reply and Re-tweet from a programming hero

First you need to know that I never [tweet](https://twitter.com/Chris_Towles). I think less than 10 in my life.

Anyway after using and reading the source code of [glide data grid](https://github.com/glideapps/glide-data-grid) I just through to send a tweet saying thanks because it why not, it totally deserved it and made me love the the project i am using it for.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank You <a href="https://twitter.com/glideapps?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@glideapps</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jassmith87?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jassmith87</a>! Your Glide Data Grid is without a doubt the best data grid on the internet. I&#39;m even using it in a vue app because its just that much better than everything else! <br>And trust me I looked. <a href="https://t.co/dPsxTYuF2Z">https://t.co/dPsxTYuF2Z</a></p>&mdash; Chris Towles (@Chris_Towles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Towles/status/1539814088666238976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2022</a></blockquote>

To my shock I got a reply from Jason himself.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you so much amigo :) Let me know if you have any problems.</p>&mdash; Jason Smith (@jassmith87) <a href="https://twitter.com/jassmith87/status/1539816474054840320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2022</a></blockquote>

And he even retweeted my tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shameless retweet because I&#39;m proud. <a href="https://t.co/t23VqcI7Mq">https://t.co/t23VqcI7Mq</a></p>&mdash; Jason Smith (@jassmith87) <a href="https://twitter.com/jassmith87/status/1539816533261619200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2022</a></blockquote>

I was really surprised. It made my day and more importantly made me think. I use library's all the time and never give back. I learn so much by standing on the shoulders of giants. I have the skills to help, to contribute to the open source community and never find the time. And to Jason its not a Shameless retweet, you should be proud. Thanks for sharing your code with the rest of us.

> TODO: I will do anther post about just the amazing [glide data grid](https://github.com/glideapps/glide-data-grid). Its basically fully functional, easy to use, data grid with really similar excel or google sheets like functionality for things like keyboard navigation, filling and filtering and copying and paste. It is a really great library considering how historically bad data grid libraries are.

### The Github Copilot Debate

So while everyone I follow on twitter had a take on Microsoft/Github beginning to charge for the service, I had a different take.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It would have been very simple for github to be ethical when they made copilot. All they had to do was add an opt-in to github where you could mark your project as allowing copilot or not. Whether or not what they&#39;re doing turns out to be legal, they eschewed the ethical option.</p>&mdash; Casey Muratori (@cmuratori) <a href="https://twitter.com/cmuratori/status/1540078652246749184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2022</a></blockquote>

Every developer I follow had code that had been used in training github copilot.

I had already got my credit card and was quick to pay for the github copilot service.

I should of been more impacted by the problem. It didn't hurt me and it should have.

### Career Direction

At work I at times I'm not sure how much I contribute to the big picture. I work my projects and help others but can not always tell if the work I do is impacting future of the company.

I think most people feel this way and we all have some impostor syndrome.

The issue is I have some ideas on how to change that but wasn't sure if the work that would require is the direction I want my career to go. It would mean a lot more systems architecture and support than strict development. I came to the conclusion that I am ok with that. Its just devOps in the way I approach it and my background in devOps is work I enjoy.

### Dark matter developer

I'm reminded of something read by Scott Hanseleman. He wrote a blog post [Dark Matter Developers: The Unseen 99%](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99).  The analogy was a good one. At the time I had a [Blogspot blog](https://christowles.blogspot.com/) with about half a million views but stopped posting at the request of a new employer.  I should of left that job running but I didn't.

And I ended up being a Dark Matter Developer.

## Solution

So lets start with the problem. I'm not a fan of the idea of being a "dark matter developer".

I follow people like [jassmith87](https://twitter.com/jassmith87), [antfu7](https://twitter.com/antfu7) (maybe the most productive developer on the planet), and [remi_rousselet](https://twitter.com/remi_rousselet). I learn from these giants, and  stand on their shoulders. I should try to let some others stand on mine.

I'm going break the problem into a few weekly and monthly tasks. Kanban style except I'm not gona overfill the backlog. The goal is to change my habits, not to set impossible goals.

### Goal: Commit Publicly at 2 least twice per week

So this should hopefully be clear.

I constantly write code, at work, on weekends and late nights but tend to continued working on what ever work task i found interesting. I've done this for the last 25 year.... (other post on realizing I've been doing this a long time later.)

**Rules:** Two public commits per week, only one of which can be a blog post.

### Goal: at least one PR merged into an Pulic quarterly

I use tons of Open source. Its time I started giving back to the community that has given me and the world so much. This career lets me live a comfortable life with my wife and kids and I should help others do the same.

**Rules:** Must have more than 100 Stars.

### Goal: Finish a Certification

I am a jack of all trades. I haven't focused in any one area and considering how much AWS i do a regular bases i keep meaning to complete a certification as a measurable task.

This seems like a good habit to improve my skills.

### Results

The plan is to follow up this post next month and see if any thing changed. I set a calendar event to update this post next month.
