So a few things have happened lately that have have made reflect on what type of developer I am.

- the great github copolite debete
- A Tweet i posted got replied to by one of programmer heros.
- Thinking about Career Driection
- Talking with my twin brother, and him pushing me to learn more `Rust`.
- reading 11 level programmer
- finding several amazing repos that Completly altered the way i saw a few things

## github copolite

So while everyone i follow on twitter from

but there the problem. It didn't hurt. me and it should have.


## Tweet from heros

people i would love to work with, people i could learn from.


## Career Direction - I solve problems

At work with some great people but at times I'm not sure how much I contribute to the big picture. I work my projects and help others but can not always tell if the work I do is impacting the company. One of the issues I have some ideas on how to change that but wasn't sure if the work that would require is the direction i want my career to go. It would mean alot more systems architecture and support than strict development. I came to the conusion that I am happiest carrar wise when i'm fixing things and solving problems, making large visible impact.

That architecture and systems design is really just devops with a Differnt name.

what have i been doing lately, for years professionally. I mean working avovouuly but to what end. I currently am the senior member of a small team at GE Aviation.

## Level 11 developer

What happened.

npm

airflow  -> breeze
rich -> rich_cli

## Solution

Break the problem into kanban (over fill the backlog) and see if can pool a task or two a week.

And to show I'm a developer and not a project manger, we are going keep the tasks so simple and easy there is no way i can fail.

The goal is to change my habits, not to set impossible goals.

### Goal: Commit Publicly at 2 per week

So this should hopefully be clear.

I constantly write code, at work, on weekends and late nights but tend to continued working on what ever work task i found interesting. I've done this for the last 25 year.... (other post on realizing I've been doing this a long time later.)

**Rules:**

### Goal: at least one PR merged into an Open Source Repo quarterly

I use tons of Open source. Its time i started giving back to the community that has given me and the world so much. This career lets me live a comforable life with my wife and kids and I should help others do the same.

Rules: Must have more than 100 Stars.
